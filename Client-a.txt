1. Start
2. Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (store it as `targetNumber`)
3. Initialize a Boolean variable `guessedCorrectly` to False
4. FOR `attempt` from 1 to 3
    a. Prompt player to guess a number between 1 and 10
    b. Read playerâ€™s guess (store it as `playerGuess`)
    c. IF `playerGuess` is equal to `targetNumber` THEN
        i. Output "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in " + `attempt` + " tries."
        ii. Set `guessedCorrectly` to True
        iii. BREAK the loop
    d. ELSE
        i. Output "Incorrect guess. Try again."
5. IF `guessedCorrectly` is False THEN
    a. Output "Sorry, you've used all your attempts. The correct number was " + `targetNumber`
