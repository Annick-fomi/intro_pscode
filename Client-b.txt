1. Start
2. Initialize starting position (x = 0, y = 0)
3. Set `destination` position (example: x = 5, y = 7)
4. WHILE current position (x, y) is not equal to `destination`
    a. Display current position to user
    b. Prompt user to enter a direction to move (north, south, east, or west)
    c. Read direction input
    d. IF direction is "north" THEN
        i. Increment y by 1
    e. ELSE IF direction is "south" THEN
        i. Decrement y by 1
    f. ELSE IF direction is "east" THEN
        i. Increment x by 1
    g. ELSE IF direction is "west" THEN
        i. Decrement x by 1
5. Output "Congratulations! You have reached your destination."
6. End
